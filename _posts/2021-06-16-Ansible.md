description: "Ansible is a kind of scripting language for distributed procedures. You have probably seen shell scripts for certain procedures before such as installing and configuring the required software for a service. It may create a user with the right permissions, install some packages, download and compile source code, fill inn a configuration file, start services, etc. Writing such a script does not take much longer then just typing inn the commands by hand. However making sure it works every time requires a lot more time and effort. What if a user already exists but with the wrong permissions, what if a file is already downloaded, what if a command returns an error message, etc. You suddenly need a lot of code around each statement to handle the exceptional cases. Then you get into the issue of how to write a script that is able to do things on multiple servers, especially if the order of operations is important. And there might be similar servers but with slight configuration differences which have to be taken into consideration when writing the scripts. \n

Ansible is designed to handle all these cases for you. It can handle most of the exceptional cases by itself. You usually describe how you want the system to look after that task is complete. For example yo may say that a service should be running and enabled to start at boot on a specific group of machines and Ansible will find out how to make that happen. \n"
