description: "Docker is a container for an application. In the old days, applications were run directly on servers and sometimes they had to pay special attention to what kind of server it was running on. Docker now says to the application: 'here, expect this kind of hardware and I'll make sure the actual hardware acts that way, so you don't have to worry about interfaces, storage, etc'. \n

Docker then says, 'By the way, I know applications usually like to be configured and connect to certain things, why don't you tell me what those are so then the higher-ups can make sure you get what you need?'' The application obliges, and Docker then exposes settings and connections so sysadmins can point them where they need to be easily, for many containers. \n

Now for the part most people may not see immediately: Docker then talks to any number of management softwares, saying 'Here, configure me', along with tens, hundreds, thousands of other containers. With configuration exposed, containers are easier to manage and change. And then, with software made to launch docker container containers, you can put out new containers with new configurations easily, then kill off the old ones or leave them around in case anything goes wonky. Some OSes, like CoreOS, go one step further and let you move Docker containers around to different hardware automatically, making the servers a layer instead of a single thing, as well as making configurations easier by copying (replicating) them among all the serves automatically. \n

TL;DR: Docker is mostly exciting because it makes the application more portable, changing the cornerstone of how IT used to be (application stuck on one machine, hard to change/upgrade, hard to manage in general). \n

It's not the only containerized platform either, but they all follow the same basic concept. Instead of virtualizing the hardware and software, you virtualize the hardware and give the software a very rigidly defined set of interfaces that make it easier to make things that scale, are redundant, and resilient. \n"
