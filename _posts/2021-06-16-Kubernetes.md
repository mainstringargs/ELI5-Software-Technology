description: "Container systems, e.g. Docker, create packages (images) for applications, which make them more portable, easing the development process. Docker can be used to run sets of containers on a single host based on these images.\n

When companies want to run these containers at scale, they need a system which can manage deploying containers across a set of systems. These systems will schedule sets of containers to sets of VMs (or physical servers) and can do things like move containers around from VM to VM automatically as needed.\n

Kubernetes is the most popular of the set of systems which carry out this function.\n"
